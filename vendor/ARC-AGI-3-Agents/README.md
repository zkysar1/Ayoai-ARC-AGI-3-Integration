Initial Release

## Observability (Optional)

[AgentOps](https://agentops.ai/) is an observability platform designed for providing real-time monitoring, debugging, and analytics for your agent's behavior, helping you understand how your agents perform and make decisions.

### Installation

AgentOps is already included as an optional dependency in this project. To install it:

```bash
uv sync --extra agentops
```

Or if you're installing manually:

```bash
pip install -U agentops
```

### Getting Your API Key

1. Visit [app.agentops.ai](https://app.agentops.ai) and create an account if you haven't already
2. Once logged in, click on "New Project" to create a project for your ARC-AGI-3 agents
3. Give your project a meaningful name (e.g., "ARC-AGI-3-Agents")
4. After creating the project, you'll see your project dashboard
5. Click on the "API Keys" tab on the left side & copy the API key

### Configuration

1. Add your AgentOps API key to your `.env` file:

```bash
AGENTOPS_API_KEY=aos_your_api_key_here
```

2. The AgentOps integration is automatically initialized when you run an agent. The tracing decorator `@trace_agent_session` is already applied to agent execution methods in the codebase.

3. When you run your agent, you'll see AgentOps initialization messages and session URLs in the console:

```bash
🖇 AgentOps: Session Replay for your-agent-name: https://app.agentops.ai/sessions?trace_id=xxxxx
```

4. Click on the session URL to view real-time traces of your agent's execution. You can also view the traces in the AgentOps dashboard by locating the trace ID in the "Traces" tab.

### Using AgentOps with Custom Agents

If you're creating a custom agent, the tracing is automatically applied through the `@trace_agent_session` decorator on the `main()` method. No additional code changes are needed.
